# 关于hybrid learning
    1. What
	Hybrid learning, also known as neuro-symbolic AI, is an advanced version of artificial intelligence that improves how a neural network arrives at a decision by adding classical rules-based (symbolic) AI to the process. 
	This hybrid approach requires less training data and makes it possible for humans to track how AI programming made decision
	Hybrid learning is a better model for leveraging machine learning and human Expertise
	
	2. Why hybrid learning
	For achieving high accuracy, deep learning requires a large amount of data that is sometimes difficult, expensive, or impractical to obtain. Integrating human knowledge into machine learning can significantly reduce data requirement, increase reliability and robustness of machine learning, and build explainable machine learning systems.
